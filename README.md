## Inspiration

### 1. Robo Vacuum Simulator
Robo Vacuum Simulator is one of our primary inspirations. In this game, the player controls a cleaner robot to suck up garbage in a variety of settings. We want to add more elements to our game, including changes in weather/lighting, a point system for the garbage collected, and possible "enemies" such as pets that must be avoided. Our robot would ideally be round instead of square.

### 2. Roombo: First Blood
This 3D action game on Steam features a cleaner robot that uses various gadgets to defend a house from invaders. After the battle, the robot cleans up the mess left behind. Our focus is on the cleaning mechanics rather than combat. We aim to include a challenge element by introducing household pets as obstacles at higher difficulty levels.

## Development Plan  

### Project Checkpoint 1-2: Basic Mechanics and Scripting (Ch 5-9)

- **Tasks Completed:**
  - ~~Created prefabs for the robot, furniture, room, and trash.~~
  - ~~Implemented basic player movement using **WASD** controls.~~
  - ~~Enabled jumping to allow interaction with elevated surfaces.~~
  - ~~Implemented collision detection for trash collection.~~
  - ~~Developed basic game logic, including win and lose conditions.~~
  - ~~Created essential game scenes: **Room Scene**, **Win Scene**, and **Lose Scene**.~~

- **Deferred Tasks:**
  - **Refining Collision Detection:**  
    ~~The trash collection system works, but collision detection needs further refinement for smoother gameplay.~~
  - **UI Elements (Scoreboard & Timer):**  
    ~~Positioning issues with the UI have delayed full implementation; these will be completed in the next phase.~~

- **Additions:**
  - ~~Implemented a Game Manager script to handle win/lose conditions dynamically.~~
  - ~~Added a ‚Äúbad trash‚Äù mechanic that reduces the player‚Äôs score.~~
  - ~~Introduced a jump mechanic to allow the robot to clean trash on elevated surfaces.~~

---

### Project Part 2: 3D Scenes and Models (Ch 3+4, 10)

- **Environment Design:**
  - ~~Replaced basic primitives with detailed 3D models for furniture and household objects.~~
  - ~~Future work includes importing models with realistic proportions and textures to better simulate a home setting.~~
  
- **Texture and Material Improvements:**
  - ~~Enhanced realism by applying high-quality textures and materials to floors, walls, and trash.~~
  - Future plan: Incorporate materials with improved reflectivity, bump maps, and tiling patterns.

- **Enhanced Collision System:**
  - ~~Improved physics interactions between the robot and in-game objects using Unity‚Äôs advanced physics features.~~

- **Expanding Game Logic:**
  - ~~Introduced a more structured game loop to dynamically load different levels/scenarios.~~
  - Future plan: Add more levels to increase replayability.

- **Introducing New Gameplay Elements:**
  - **Obstacle Mechanics:**  
    ~~On collision with a trash item, the robot experiences a temporary slowdown, requiring strategic movement.~~
  - **Bad Trash Mechanic:**  
   ~~ The robot is programmed to detect and avoid ‚Äúbad trash‚Äù which negatively affects the score.~~

- **Additions:**
  - No additional tasks were made beyond the planned improvements.

---
### Project Part 3: Visual Effects (Ch 11, 12, 13)

- **Lighting and Shadows:**
  - Planned improvements include applying advanced lighting methods (e.g., night and day cycles) to enhance scene aesthetics. 
    - We followed the textbook and created a 6-sided skybox material, then applied it to the sky setting. However, the day-night cycle is not yet implemented and will be deferred to the next milestone.

- **Particle System and Visual Effects:**
  - ~~Planned use of particle systems to create vivid visual effects (e.g., fire and water) for elements such as fireplaces and sinks.~~  
    - We used Unity‚Äôs particle system to create a working fireplace visual effect.

- **Post Processing:**
  - ~~Planned use of post-processing tools (e.g., depth map) for enhanced visual quality.~~  
    - We applied post-processing effects such as bloom to enhance the game‚Äôs lighting and mood.

- **Additional Plans:**
  - ~~Future work will include additional levels with increased difficulty and integrated score calculations via text UI.~~  
    - We added a new Level 3 to fit with the new fireplace, garden, and water elements (see Additions below).

- **Additions:**
  - üÜï Added Level 3, which includes new environmental elements such as a garden, fireplace, and a plane-based moving water area.
  - üê± Introduced a cat obstacle: a cat that occasionally jumps on top of the robot vacuum and temporarily slows its movement, increasing challenge and interactivity.


‚Äî
### Project Checkpoint 3-4: Sound, UI, and Animation (Ch 14, 15, 17)
- **Sound:**
  - ~~Plan to add background music and sound effects for collision, trash pickup, and low battery.~~  
    - ‚úÖ Added background music to enhance immersion during gameplay.  
    - ‚úÖ Sound effects for collision trash pickup and jump is finished

- **UI:**
  - ~~Refine scoreboard and timer layout.~~  
    - ‚úÖ Improved scoreboard visibility and adjusted timer positioning for better readability. Added "trash remaining" to show the number of trash objects left in the current scene.
    - ‚úÖ A new winning message is now displayed, including a rank indicator based on remaining time and score.
  - ~~Implement an animated menu screen.~~  
    - üîÑ In progress ‚Äì the base menu is functional with exit (exit the game) and restart (restart current level) but further animation polish is deferred to the final milestone. We believe level selection does not fit our game logic well since each level has different difficulty, we want players not to jump levels, so we decided not to implement level selection UI. In the future we might implement a mechanism for the user to skip a level if they have already played that level, but since there is only three levels for our game that might be redundent.

- **Animation:**
  - ~~Animate trash items disappearing when collected.~~  
    - ‚úÖ Implemented: trash items now fade out when collected.
  - ~~Add idle/wheel-turning animations for the robot.~~  
    - üîÑ Wheel-turning animation is unnecessary since we can't really see the wheel very closely and clearly. 

- **Additions:**
  - ~~‚ö†Ô∏è Battery indicator not implemented yet ‚Äì may be added in the next milestone (unsure if necessary).~~
  - ~~üÜï Updated and swapped out prefab models to improve environmental consistency and clarity.~~
  - ~~üö™ Refined gameplay logic: players now reach a door to transition to the next level by hitting O (as commanded by the UI)~~
  - ~~üïπÔ∏è UI now includes options to exit and restart.~~
  - ~~üì∑ Camera animation is implemented to go over the map on the current level as the game starts.~~
  - ~~‚§¥Ô∏è Press ‚ÄòE‚Äô to rotate the camera to avoid objects blocking users‚Äô views.~~
  - ~~‚ÄºÔ∏è Implemented 'O' for next level: in order to go to the next scene, follow the instruction displayed after winning, go to the door and press 'O'~~
  - ‚ÄºÔ∏è Special note: for the ranking, there is a 5 second time window to collect beyond 10 trash (go above 100 points), this is not a bug. By doing so the player can trigger additional points and have special rankings for tasks completed in the 5 second period. Even if time ran out in this five seconds, the player still wins the game but there are not special ranks.

### Project Part 4: Finishing Touches (Ch 18, 19 + Final Polish)

- **Performance Optimization:**
  - ‚ùå Planned improvements include profiling the game and reducing bottlenecks to ensure smooth performance, especially in Level 3 which contains many assets and particle systems.  
    - Not implemented yet, but will be completed by the final project submission. This is more of a final step, and performance has been acceptable during playtesting due to the game's lightweight nature.

- **Menu and Scene Transitions:**
  - ~~Planned updates to main menu visuals and smoother scene transitions.~~  
    - ‚úÖ For better user experience, we added on-screen instructions at the bottom (e.g., ‚ÄúPress ESC to exit the game‚Äù or ‚ÄúO for next level‚Äù) after players complete a level. These help users navigate more easily with the keyboard.
  - ~~Final polish on animations will be added in the last week.~~  
    - ‚úÖ We polished the cat animations and adjusted their positions. The robot can now turn and face the correct direction as it moves, improving overall visual feedback.

- **Additions:**
  - ~~üêû Fixed WASD movement input bug for smoother control.~~  
  - ~~üí¨ Added floating "+10" (green) and "-10" (red) text when picking up good or bad trash ‚Äî enhances player feedback (game juice). Extra particle effect was considered for this but ultimately not added due to unsatisfactory visuals.~~  
  - ~~‚úÖ WebGL deployment complete; game uploaded to itch.io. Game jam submission completed on April 24.~~  
  - ~~üÖ∞Ô∏è Added end-of-level performance rank system (A/B/C) based on trash collected ‚Äî adds extra juice and replay motivation.~~
  - ~~Added a short message at the beginning of Level 1 during the camera zoom-in sequence. This text explains the basic gameplay goal and bonus system to help new players understand objectives right away.~~

‚Äî--

### Project Final Submission

- **Sound:**
  - ~~We plan to add more sound effects (cat sounds, fire sounds, ambient sounds, etc.) to create a more immersive experience.~~  
    - ‚úÖ Added cat SFX: the cat now plays a meow sound when it jumps onto the player.  
    - ‚úÖ Added ambient rain sound for Level 3.  
    - üîä *Sound references:*  
      - Cat meow: [Pixabay ‚Äì Cat Meow](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/cat-meow-297927/)  
      - Rain ambient: [SoundCloud ‚Äì Sayama Rain](https://soundcloud.com/naturesoundsjp/sayama-rain-1)

- **Tutorial:**
  - ~~We plan to add an introductory level before level one to teach new players how to play this game. We plan to use interactive UI elements in the introductory level.~~  
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è Not fully implemented. Instead, we added helpful tips and on-screen text during Level 1 and Level 2 to guide the player through key mechanics.
    
- **Additions:**
  - ‚úÖ Added a pause at the start of each level so that the camera can pan across the scene before gameplay begins. During this time, the timer does not count down and the player cannot move, giving players a chance to observe the layout.
  - ‚úÖ Changed the color of some in-game text for better readability and aesthetic consistency (e.g., instructions, scores).

## Instructions for Testing the Project

- **Opening the Project:**
  - Open the Unity project in the Unity Editor.
  - In the **Project** window, navigate to the `Scenes` folder.
  - Start by opening `MainMenu.unity` to access the level selection menu.
  - Alternatively, load `level1`, `level2`, or `level3` directly to test specific scenes.

- **Gameplay Controls:**
  - **W, A, S, D:** Move the robot.
  - **Space:** Jump (to reach trash on elevated surfaces).
  - **Mouse:** Navigate menus and click UI buttons.
  - The robot automatically collects trash upon collision.
  - The player transitions to the next level by reaching the door once the target is met and pressiong 'O'

- **Core Scenes & Their Purposes:**
  - **MainMenu Scene:** Access the level selection screen and start or replay levels.
  - **Level 1‚Äì3 Scenes:** Main gameplay areas for trash collection, obstacle avoidance, and scene-based challenges.
  - ~~**Win Scene:** Displays ‚ÄúYou Win‚Äù after collecting the required number of trash items and reaching the door.~~
  - ~~**Lose Scene:** Displays ‚ÄúYou Lost‚Äù if the trash collection target isn‚Äôt met within the time limit.~~

- **Additional Mechanics to Test:**
  - **New Trash Types:** Includes mud, cans, and money‚Äîsome may act as obstacles or "bad trash."
  - **Cat Obstacle (Level 3):** A roaming cat may jump on the robot and temporarily slow it down.
  - **New Level 3:** Features new environmental elements like the fireplace, garden, and water; increased difficulty.
  - **Menu UI:** Includes animated buttons to start/restart levels, return to main menu, and select scenes.
  - **Trash Pickup Animation & Sound:** Visual fade-out and sound effect feedback when trash is collected.

- **Additional Notes:**
  - Use the Unity Profiler if testing performance or frame drops in Level 3.
  - Cat collision and slowdown mechanics are currently set to a 15-second duration‚Äîcan be tweaked in `CatBehavior.cs`.
  - UI layout may require adjustment if tested on different screen resolutions or aspect ratios.
  - The player is exptected to collect 10 trash, 100 points total. good trash (the colored cans) will award the player with 10 points each and 1 trash collcted, the bad trash (US dollars) should be avoided and if collected will give the player -10 points and -1 trash collected. The player wins by collecting 10 trash and getting 100 points (including deductions, so player might need to actually collect beyond 10 trash if they collected any bad trash). Once 100 points are met, the player will have 5 seconds to collect more trash, if they got beyond 100/130 points, they will get a special ranking. If the player's point go below 100 or time ran out during this period, the player still wins. Failing to collect 10 trash in the time limit will loose the game, and the player can select restart or quit.

### Future Work

In possible further development of this game, we propose implementing the following features:

- **Dynamic Lighting System:**  
  Introduce a day/night cycle that challenges players to complete levels under varying lighting conditions, enhancing gameplay complexity and immersion.

- **More Variety of Pets:**  
  Develop a more diverse range of interactive pets with different abilities that hinder the player. For example, a dog could eat trash before the player can collect it, reducing the maximum possible score in the level.

- **Interactive Environment Elements:**  
  Incorporate movable and destructible objects, potentially reducing scores when damaged or destroyed. For example, the player might accidentally knock over and break a vase on a table, resulting in a score penalty.

- **More Levels:**  
  Create more scenes with different environments for the player to play, including new in door and out door scenes. We also plan to add different trash in accordance with the scenes.
