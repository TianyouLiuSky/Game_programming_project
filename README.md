Inspiration
1. Pac-Man
Pac-Man is a classic 2D game from the 1980s, where players navigate a maze, collecting points while avoiding enemies. Its gameplay is engaging and timeless. For our project, adapting this concept into a 3D environment with everyday settings could create a fresh and exciting experience. Given the enduring success of the original, this classic gameplay model has already proven to be a strong foundation for a great game.

2. Roombo: First Blood
This 3D action game on Steam features a cleaner robot that utilizes various gadgets to defend a house from invaders. After the battle, the robot diligently cleans up both the house and the mess caused by the fight. Our focus, however, is on the cleaning aspect rather than the combat. We aim to draw inspiration from the robotâ€™s cleaning mechanics while introducing a challenge element: at higher difficulty levels, players must navigate around pets in the house, simulating the real-life obstacles a robotic vacuum might encounter.

3. Rock Simulator
 Rock Simulator is a well-known game on Steam, offering a unique experience where players embody a rock, simply existing and witnessing different environments and weather conditions. The concept of a "simulator" that allows players to take on the role of an everyday object is particularly intriguing to us, as it provides a fresh and immersive perspective on the world.

This design aims to provide a realistic and engaging simulation of a robot vacuum cleaner's operations within a dynamic home setting.

Development Plan
Project Checkpoint 1-2:
Implement scripts of player actions
Create prefabs for game objects (furnitures, dusts)
Create a basic map for the easy mode
Implement basic interactions between player and environment (collision, collection)
