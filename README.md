## Inspiration
### 1. Robo Vacuum Simulator
Robo Vacuum Simulator is one of our primary inspirations. The player player a cleaner robot to suck up garbage in a variety of settings. We want to add more elements to the game, including change of weather/lighting, a point system for the garbages gathered, and possible "enemies" such as pets that you need to avoid. Our robot would also ideally be round instead of square

### 2. Roombo: First Blood
This 3D action game on Steam features a cleaner robot that utilizes various gadgets to defend a house from invaders. After the battle, the robot diligently cleans up both the house and the mess caused by the fight. Our focus, however, is on the cleaning aspect rather than the combat. We aim to draw inspiration from the robotâ€™s cleaning mechanics while introducing a challenge element: at higher difficulty levels, players must navigate around pets in the house, simulating the real-life obstacles a robotic vacuum might encounter.

### 3. Rock Simulator
 Rock Simulator is a well-known game on Steam, offering a unique experience where players embody a rock, simply existing and witnessing different environments and weather conditions. The concept of a "simulator" that allows players to take on the role of an everyday object is particularly intriguing to us, as it provides a fresh and immersive perspective on the world.

## Gameplay:

Assume control of an advanced robot vacuum cleaner within a meticulously detailed 3D home environment.
Player Role: Assume control of an advanced robot vacuum cleaner within a meticulously detailed 3D home environment.

### Objectives:

#### Easy Mode: 
Navigate through various rooms to collect a specified amount of dust while overcoming obstacles such as jumping onto tables, avoiding collisions with sofas, and maneuvering under furniture.
Medium Mode: In addition to dust collection, avoid interference from household pets like cats and dogs, which can hinder your progress.
Hard Mode: Defend the home from intruders by utilizing built-in defensive mechanisms, showcasing the vacuum's advanced home security features.
Mechanics:

#### Item Interaction: 
Collect and utilize various items to enhance performance, such as speed boosts or temporary shields.
Time Management: Complete tasks within set time limits to advance to subsequent levels.
Dynamic Environment: Experience realistic day-night cycles and weather changes that affect visibility and navigation.

### Graphics:

The game features a first-person perspective with low-poly graphics, creating a stylized yet immersive environment.
Visual Style: The game features a first-person perspective with low-poly graphics, creating a stylized yet immersive environment.

Lighting and Effects: High-contrast lighting and particle systems enhance the visual experience, especially during interactions like dust collection and obstacle navigation.

This design aims to provide a realistic and engaging simulation of a robot vacuum cleaner's operations within a dynamic home setting.

## Development Plan
### Project Checkpoint 1-2:
Implement scripts of player actions
Create prefabs for game objects (furnitures, dusts)
Create a basic map for the easy mode
Implement basic interactions between player and environment (collision, collection)
